## Usage

The guide is divided into sections which each address a topic covered in the prework modules. The page itself serves as an example of using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to give structure, style and function to a webpage. The sections provide a place for the student to take notes on each subject. If the console is opened, the results of the Javascript functions can be seen logged to the console (listing the topics and choosing a random one to suggest studying first). There is also a section covering Git and GitHub version control.
