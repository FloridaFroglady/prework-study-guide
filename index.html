        <ul>
          <li>
            The head element contains information about the webpage for the
            browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            The head element contains metadata about the character set and
            viewport.
          </li>
          <li>
            The head element also contains the website title, which is displayed
            on the browser tab. This is usually the only child of the head
            element that is visible to the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.
          </li>
          <li>The body element can include text, images and hyperlinks.</li>
          <li>
            The body element can also contain scripts to make the page
            interactive.
          </li>
          <li>
            Semantic HTML elements are preferred because they help users with
            screen readers understand the page structure and the purpose of each
            element.

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an
            element.
          </li>
          <li>
            A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside
            an element.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can apply CSS styles to every element of a certain type or give
            classes and ids to elements you wish to target directly.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can use inline styles for each individual element or an internal
            style sheet for each page, but it's better to use an external style
            sheet so you can access and change styles throughout the whole app
            by editing a single file.
          </li>
          <li>
            CSS is often said to follow the "box model". From the outside in,
            the parts of the box are Margin-->border-->padding-->contents

            Git flow is to open an issue, make a branch, write code for the
            branch, add the code to git, commit the code to the repository, open
            a pull request to check the new code, merge the branch into the main
            branch of the remote repository, close the issue, pull the new main
            branch into your local repository.
