        <ul>
          <li>
            The head element contains information about the webpage for the
            browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            The head element contains metadata about the character set and
            viewport.
          </li>
          <li>
            The head element also contains the website title, which is displayed
            on the browser tab. This is usually the only child of the head
            element that is visible to the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.
          </li>
          <li>The body element can include text, images and hyperlinks.</li>
          <li>
            The body element can also contain scripts to make the page
            interactive.
          </li>
          <li>
            Semantic HTML elements are preferred because they help users with
            screen readers understand the page structure and the purpose of each
            element.

          <li>
            A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an
            element.
          </li>
          <li>
            A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside
            an element.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can apply CSS styles to every element of a certain type or give
            classes and ids to elements you wish to target directly.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can use inline styles for each individual element or an internal
            style sheet for each page, but it's better to use an external style
            sheet so you can access and change styles throughout the whole app
            by editing a single file.
          </li>
          <li>
            CSS is often said to follow the "box model". From the outside in,
            the parts of the box are Margin-->border-->padding-->contents

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>

          </li>
          <li>
            Git flow is to open an issue, make a branch, write code for the
            branch, add the code to git(git add -A), commit the code to the
            repository(push), open a pull request to check the new code, merge
            the branch into the main branch of the remote repository, close the
            issue, pull the new main branch into your local repository.git

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our
            code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a
            script.
          </li>
          <li>
            Browsers execute code from the top down, so the script tag with a JS
            file linked to it should be placed at the bottom of the HTML body to
            allow the HTML to load first.
          </li>
          <li>
            JS also executes code from the top down, so be sure every variable
            used in a function is declared before writing the function and that
            the function is written before calling it.
          </li>
          <li>
            functions allow us to alter the control flow by calling them when we
            wish them to execute, instead of automatically executing where they
            are written in the file.
          </li>
          <li>JS is a OOP language, so everything is an object.</li>
          <li>
            JS does not require declaration of explicit data types. Data types
            can be coerced to other types if necessary to run the code. This can
            cause problems if it isn't intended or desired.
          </li>
          <li>For loops allow iteration through an array.</li>
          <li>
            If...else allows choices to be made when certain conditions are
            met/not met.
